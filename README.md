Token Classification and Relation Detection for Bio Articles

## Notebooks
* [`Parser.ipynb`](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/Parser.ipynb) ([nbviewer](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/Parser.ipynb)) -  Parsing and Pre-Processing data
* [`IOB_converter.ipynb`](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/IOB_converter.ipynb)([nbviewer](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/IOB_converter.ipynb)) - Convertation dataset to the IOB format (inside, outside, beginning) - common tagging format for tagging tokens
* [`TokenClassification.ipynb`](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/TokenClassification.ipynb) ([nbviewer](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/TokenClassification.ipynb)) -  Finetuning `bert-base-cased`, `scibert-scivocab-cased` and `biobert-v1.1-pubmed-base-cased model` on dataset in IOB format. Comparing the results
* [`TokenClassification.ipynb`](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/TokenClassification.ipynb) ([nbviewer](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/TokenClassification.ipynb)) -  Finetuning `bert-base-cased`, `scibert-scivocab-cased` and `biobert-v1.1-pubmed-base-cased model` on dataset in IOB format. Comparing the results
* [`Scibert_TokenClassification.ipyn`](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/Scibert_TokenClassification.ipynb) ([nbviewer](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/Scibert_TokenClassification.ipynb)) -  Hyperparameters Tuning for `scibert-scivocab-cased` as it was shown the best performance among other models. Developing functions for extracting entities from user's text and visualizing results with `displacy`
* [`KnowledgeGraphs.ipynb`](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/KnowledgeGraphs.ipynb) ([nbviewer](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/KnowledgeGraphs.ipynb)) - Trying out Relation Extraction methods without usage of NER Entities. Developing functions for further building of Knowledge Graphs and visualizaing th results.
[`RelationExtractionBetweenEntities.ipynb`](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/RelationExtractionBetweenEntities.ipynb) ([nbviewer](https://github.com/Teasotea/BioNER-and-RD/blob/main/RelationExtractionBetweenEntities.ipynb)) - This work is unfinished. Futher steps will be to develop functions for extracting entity pairs in given text and the relation between them. This could be done in similar way with approch in `KnowledgeGraphs.ipynb` notebook.
